<!--P.S - IÂ´ve already learned plenty, I hope you will start your path with this info above and then continue doing stuff yourself. Googling is a good way to find out something new and of course valuable to move smoothly in Terminal. Keep in mind, that GIT has a huge quantity of different commands to be used in Terminal in order to connect to GITHUB and then operate. So, goodluck my unknown and never met friend/enemy. Thanks for your attention mate-->
